# actuallyworkingyelpscaper
An actually working yelp scraper that works. I know, insane.

This was made for a specific purpose so ignore some references to software or whatever. I wanted to publish it anyway because it seems to be the only yelp scraper that also tries to scrape the names of the business owners.

# How to use
Lol, the code kind of sucks, because I'm bad at coding, so don't use it if you can't edit the code a bit yourself. But it works, even though it's probably terribly inefficient. Anyway, things to note:
- Currently hard coded for Canadian Yelp (yelp.ca) so change to yelp.com in the code for US.
- When launching it you get instructions on how to use it, but they suck so good luck with that.
- It saves the results in a csv file titled "results.csv" which you can then import to like google sheets so it's actually legible.
- In rare cases the "owner names" will be something strange like "1 week" or some random element it gets from Yelp. Just make sure to go through the sheet once and clean up any mistakes it makes.

Good luck, lol!
